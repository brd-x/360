(Because the actual project is far from complete, many notes in this document are based on the apps purpose, and not reflective on the actual submission)

The requirements of this project were to create an inventory control application designed run on Android mobile devices.
The specifics of this project include creating a login and register system, saving data through a SQLite database, and creating SMS notification functionality.

There are two main screens; the login screen and the table screen. The latter screen contains sub-screens for adding, removing, and editing items.
The UI is designed to be easy to follow and understand.

I apporoched the process of coding by designing the application first, and using the code to replicate that idea.
I procedureally tested for bugs while making the code in order to narrow bugs down easier.
This process can be applied in the future when making new programs.

I tested to make sure my code was functional by testing it everytime I add something new to the UI.
This process is important to prevent you from developing too far ahead when there could be bugs that would prevent new code from working.

I don't believe I was very successful in creating this project, as many key components do not function.
However, I do have a solid understanding of components such as buttons, labels, and textboxes. My issues lie in SQLite, which is needlessly complicated.
A Java.io.File implementation, perhaps along side a stack data struct, would be more intuitive, effecient and easy to uderstand and develop for.
